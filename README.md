# Anomaly Detection IoT23
## Research Paper
This project is part of the research under   
*Machine Learning and Deep Learning Methods for Better Anomaly Detection in IoT-23 Dataset Cybersecurity*.  
  
* The goal of the research was to find the best solution based on time efficiency and accuracy.  
* This paper proposed an anomaly detection system model for IoT security with the implementation of ML/DL methods, including Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, Decision Trees, and CNN.  
* The proposed method reached better accuracy compared to other paper.  
* The research was performed on the IoT-23 dataset.
